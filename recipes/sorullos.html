        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Sorullos is a classic Puerto Rican appetizer. 
                I mostly make it to go along with breakfast as they 
                taste great when dipped in a fried egg yolk or butter!
                <br>I&apos;m sure you could find other ways to introduce this dish
                with other meals, especially if you use a mayochup dip or even syrup.
            </p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <p>The ingredients required to make Sorullos is very small.
                    In fact, it&apos;s likely you have many of the ingredients on hand!
                    Here&apos;s what we need:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cornmeal, 1 cup</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Pepper</li>
                    <li>Water</li>
                    <li>Canola Oil</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The measurements we need depend on how many servings you&apos;d like
                    to make. For now 1 cup of cornmeal should work, but feel free
                    to add more if you like! <br>Salt and pepper is mainly to taste, so
                    you would add that to your liking as well.
                </p>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Despite the few ingredients we have here, it&apos;s actually a little
                tricky to make these things!
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, we&apos;re gonna take our canola oil and let it heat up in a pan. Then,
                    we&apos;ll bring some water to a boil. Leave both of those to heat up.
                    <br>You&apos;ll know when the oil is ready when you see ripples. Make sure
                    you bring the water off the heater once it's boiling, we don&apos;t want
                    to burn ourselves.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Next, we&apos;ll pour our cornmeal into a large bowl. Don&apos;t forget to add 
                    salt and pepper to taste! Make sure you mix it well so the salt and pepper
                    mix in well.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Once our cornmeal mixture is ready and seasoned and the oil is ready to go,
                    we&apos;re going to make a well for water in the cornmeal. <br>Start by sifting
                    all of the cornmeal to the side and pouring a little bit of the hot water in
                    the space.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Now that the well is ready, we&apos;re going to go ahead and start forming sorullos!
                    Roll some cornmeal and water in your hand so that it starts to stick. <br>Try and create
                    cylinders that aren&apos;t too thick in the middle, otherwise it might not cook well inside.
                    Then, when a sorullos is formed, you can gently place it into the oil. <br>Be careful that
                    you don&apos;t burn yourself!
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Repeat the process until cornmeal is depleted. Make with some fried eggs and meat
                    of your choice, and dip it in some butter. Tasty! Enjoy your sorullos!
                </li>
